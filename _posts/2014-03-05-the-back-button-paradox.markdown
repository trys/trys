The way we interact with the web is changing fast. We browse on mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops; even watches are getting smarter. It’s only natural that the content we publish and the way it is displayed should develop at the same rate. Unfortunately that’s not the case with many websites. Older sites (and sadly an alarming number of new websites) struggle to keep pace with the number of devices that view them; they just can’t adapt on a device by device basis. Adaption is what responsive design is all about.

>Responsive design ensures your website is displayed in its optimum form on any device.

By adapting to each specific device, a website can alter how it looks and functions to best suit the user.

## So why do I need it?

The simple answer is usability. If the user has to zoom, scroll horizontally, or rotate the screen to navigate the website, they’ll need a pretty good reason to stay. A fixed-width website is a huge usability barrier when browsing on a mobile device. If the user has to choose between a difficult-to-navigate fixed-width site and an alternative easy-to-use responsive site – the decision isn’t a hard one.

The statistics speak for themselves. John Lewis recently announced that “42% of their online traffic now comes from smartphones and tablets” and they have “seen mobile orders more than double on a year ago” BBC Article. Below is a comparison of the John Lewis website on a mobile device – one with mobile-friendly styling, one as fixed-width.
